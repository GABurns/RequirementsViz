Estimands on Time to Event Variables

</h1>

<h2 align="center">

Summary

</h2>

- Each Patient can only have a maximum of one of each event type.
- The earliest event type take precedence if more than more occurs within study.
- Unless an intercurrent event is defined with a 'no nothing strategy'. Then the
next earliest event (without a do nothing strategy) is selected.
- If no events occur within the study duration, the censor variable is the study length
